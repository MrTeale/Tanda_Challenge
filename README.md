# Tanda_Challenge

## The Challenge

Investigate and present the following in whichever format you think is most appropriate:

- The percentage of users which change each setting.
- The distribution of users that change > x% of settings overall.
- The difference in configuration between explicit and implicit settings (we theorize the explicit settings are more likely to be set by users)
- A general method for determining the set of users which will be affected should a setting (or set of settings) be removed/hidden.
- Existing settings are visible for editing at https://my.tanda.co/settings (you can sign up for a free trial to see it). Make a recommendation on structural improvements to the page based on your findings.

### Solution
